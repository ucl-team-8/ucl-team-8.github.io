# Achievements

Related to the algorithm, the following are our key achievements:

- The algorithm works in **real-time**, as required by our client.
- The algorithm generates results **incrementally**â€”only the part of the result that is affected by the change is recalculated, leaving the rest unchanged.
- With the **layered design**, the algorithm can operate in 3 separate workers, communicating between layers with **data stores**.

We also created a [**visualisation**]({{ site.baseurl }}/visualisations/demo/) to inspect the matchings and provided it with the final prototype.
