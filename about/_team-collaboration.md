# Team Collaboration

We decided to use [**Trello**](http://www.trello.com), a Kanban style tool, for sharing ideas and setting deadlines. Trello is a tool that allows you to communicate by creating lists, which contain cards. It is a very flexible tool that gives you an easy overview and quick access to important information.

Next we still needed a way to share documents and collaborate on the creation of those documents. We found that [**Google Drive**](http://drive.google.com) was an ideal solution since it was free and very easy-to-use.

## Version Control

Since we all wanted to develop together, we had to use source control. This would allow us to make changes at the same time and if anything went wrong, we could simply revert back to the last commit.

All of us were used to using Git and Github therefore we decided to use both. However someone would usually set up a repository and then everyone would contribute to that one. But for this project, we needed various repositories for different projects. Therefore we decided to set up an organization, so all of the repositories are in one place.

Our organization's profile can be found on [**this link**](https://github.com/ucl-team-8).

## Work Packages
For the second part of the term, we assigned each team member various responsibilities. This does not necessarily mean that he had to finish the entire work package on their own but they were responsible for completing it before the internal deadline. Below you can see some of the most important work packages, together with the person responsible.
