# Testing Strategies

When developing the prototype, we tried to automate testing as much as possible. We will continue doing so in the second term, mainly by writing Unit Tests.

## Unit Tests

We will have a test suite written for the main algorithm itself which includes:

+ The matching of station names and the geographical locations
+ The matching of the time within x minutes
+ Matching of event type
+ Matching headcodes with specific train types and rough destinations
+ Matching services to rolling stock with Genius Allocations
