# User Interface

The user interface of our application would have a map, where we visualize all of the Services and Rolling Stock in different colors. Then another section would list all of the units that have been identified as not matching their services. Also, there will be an option to change the matching parameters like time and distance between Tiplocs. Finally, you can also select a particular Rolling Stock or Service on the map in order to get more information on it.

Hence, the prototype application should only be a single page. A sketch of that page is provided below.
