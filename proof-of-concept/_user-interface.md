# User Interface

    TODO: Add pictures + wireframe?

We would like to have a couple of different screens, each displaying the results in a different way. First of all, the first screen will display all the changes that have already happened. Hence, the user can have a quick view if all the Rolling Stock are following the Diagrams or if something has not gone according to plan.

Then, the user will also be able to select a particular Rolling Stock, and see all of the GPS Reports and all of the services that it might have run in a similar fashion than our second visualization.

Next, the user can also select to see the Diagrams of what actually happened and compare them to the actual Diagrams.
